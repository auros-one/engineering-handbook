# Product Roadmap Workflow

Apply when working on high-level project planning, feature definition, prioritization, or product strategy. This workflow helps structure the process of defining requirements, analyzing user needs, organizing feature development, and planning implementation timelines.

Use when you need to translate ideas into structured development plans or create documentation for future implementation work.

## Step-by-Step Approach for Roadmap Planning

### Step 1: Requirement & Definition

- Engage the user in discussion to understand their product vision
- Ask clarifying questions about:
  - Target users and their needs
  - Key problems to solve
  - Success metrics and goals
  - Technical and business constraints
- Document requirements and acceptance criteria in a structured format

### Step 2: Roadmap Structuring

- Create a comprehensive roadmap with clearly defined sections:
  - Executive summary
  - Requirements and user stories
  - Technical architecture overview
  - Data model design
  - API specifications
  - Implementation phases
  - Timeline and milestones
- Present the structure to the user for feedback and approval

### Key Steps for Each Feature

- Propose technical spikes to verify feasibility and assumptions
- Design and document data models with clear relationships
- Define API endpoints and integration points
- Break down implementation into manageable tasks
- Identify dependencies and potential risks

### Continuous Validation & Updates

- Regularly check alignment with original requirements
- Update documentation to reflect current decisions and changes
- Summarize progress at key milestones
- Ask for user feedback on prioritization and direction

## Best Practices

- Break complex features into small, verifiable components
- Provide clear context and rationale for each recommendation
- Maintain consistent communication throughout the planning process
- Keep documentation dynamic and up-to-date
- Consider both technical feasibility and business value

## Key Questions to Ask

- "What are the must-have features versus nice-to-haves?"
- "Are there any existing systems this needs to integrate with?"
- "What's the target timeline for the MVP?"
- "Who are the primary stakeholders I should consider?"
- "What are the main technical constraints or preferences?"

## Benefits

- Prevents ambiguity and misunderstandings early in the process
- Ensures alignment between technical implementation and business goals
- Creates a clear roadmap that guides development
- Produces comprehensive documentation for team collaboration
- Enables informed decision-making throughout the project lifecycle
