# Product Roadmap Workflow

Apply when working on high-level project planning, feature definition, prioritization, or product strategy. This workflow helps structure the process of defining requirements, analyzing user needs, organizing feature development, and planning implementation timelines.

Use when you need to translate ideas into structured development plans or create documentation for future implementation work.

## Step-by-Step Approach for Roadmap Planning

### Step 1: Requirement & Definition

- Discuss and define clear feature requirements.
- Document constraints and acceptance criteria clearly.

### Step 2: Roadmap Structuring

- Organize your roadmap into clearly defined sections (e.g., requirements, design, data model, API).
- Clearly outline technical spikes (feasibility prototypes), data model designs, and other relevant tasks.

### Key Steps for Each Feature

- Conduct a technical spike to verify assumptions.
- Clearly document data models and initial data setup.
- Iteratively execute tasks with continuous reference to documentation.

### Continuous Validation & Updates

- Continuously validate results against original requirements.
- Regularly update documentation to reflect current status and changes.

## Best Practices

- Small, verifiable instructions rather than broad directives.
- Clear context and boundary specifications.
- Consistent iterative refinement through structured dialogues.
- Dynamic and continually updated documentation.

## Benefits

- Prevents ambiguity, misunderstandings, and project stagnation.
- Ensures structured, successful project completion.
- Produces clear, maintainable code supported by comprehensive documentation.
