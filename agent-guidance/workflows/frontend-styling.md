# Frontend Style & UI Workflow

Apply when working on user interface elements, visual design, styling, or UI/UX improvements. This workflow is appropriate for tasks focused on enhancing visual consistency, improving user experience, implementing design systems, or styling new components.

Use when the primary goal is aesthetics, usability, or design language consistency rather than functional implementation.

## Step-by-Step Guide

### 1. Understand Visual Requirements

- Ask the user if they have a reference design or visual inspiration
- If they provide an image or reference, analyze it for styling patterns
- Focus on extracting styling elements rather than functionality

### 2. Generate Detailed Style Guide

- When analyzing visual references, create a comprehensive style guide that includes:
  - Color palette and usage patterns
  - Typography (fonts, sizes, weights, line heights)
  - Spacing system (margins, padding, gaps)
  - Border styles and radii
  - Shadow and elevation patterns
  - Animation and transition preferences
  - Overall visual mood and feel

### 3. Confirm Style Direction

- Present the extracted style guide to the user for validation
- Ask clarifying questions about specific design preferences:
  - "Should I apply this color scheme throughout the entire application?"
  - "Do you want to maintain these exact spacing ratios?"
  - "Are there any existing brand guidelines I should follow?"

### 4. Implementation Strategy

- Break down the styling implementation into logical phases:
  - Global styles and CSS variables
  - Component-specific styling
  - Responsive design adjustments
  - Interaction states (hover, focus, active)
- Implement styles systematically, ensuring consistency across components
- Use modern CSS practices and maintain clean, maintainable stylesheets

### 5. Iterative Refinement

- After each styling update, summarize the changes made
- Ask for feedback on specific elements
- Make incremental adjustments based on user preferences
- Ensure the result matches the desired aesthetics

## Best Practices

- Always start by understanding the visual goals before implementing
- Maintain consistency in styling patterns across the application
- Document style decisions in comments for future reference
- Consider accessibility when applying visual styles
- Test responsive behavior across different screen sizes
