## How To Use This Sketchbook

1. **Begin each new session** by reviewing the Current Tasks and Open Questions
2. **Start a new Development History entry** for significant work sessions
3. **Document your active workflow** when following specific workflows
4. **Record key decisions** and their rationale
5. **Update the Project Overview** as the project evolves
6. **Keep Implementation Notes** updated with technical patterns
7. **Maintain chronological order** with newest entries at the top of each section
```

## Usage Guidelines

1. **Regular Updates**: Add new entries as development progresses
2. **Chronological Order**: Add new development notes at the top of each section
3. **Workflow Tracking**: Document when workflows are started and completed
4. **Decision Documentation**: Record important decisions and their rationale
5. **File References**: Include file paths when discussing specific implementations

## Purpose of the Sketchbook

The sketchbook serves several critical functions for AI agents:

1. **Continuity**: Maintains context between work sessions
2. **Decision tracking**: Records key decisions and their rationale
3. **Progress monitoring**: Keeps track of completed and planned tasks
4. **Knowledge retention**: Preserves important technical details
5. **Workflow tracking**: Documents which formal workflows are being applied
6. **Question management**: Tracks unresolved questions and areas needing input

AI agents should create and maintain the sketchbook as a living document, updating it at the start and end of each significant work session. This provides both the user and the AI with a clear understanding of the project's state and history.
